# C Libraries

This package contains supported C libraries in this interpreter. Only libraries written here and functions inside them are allowed.

Here is the list of supported libraries(functions):

* [stdio.h](stdio.py)
    * int scanf(args)
    * int printf(args)
    * char getchar()
* [math.h](math.py)
    * double sqrt(double)

*You can easily extend this list by adding functions to existing files or by creating new .py file named as library and adding new functions to it*
